Exercise 1

1. Create a Java program creates a class called Employee to store information about employees. The class has the following instance variables:

- name (String)
- age (int)
- salary (double)

2. The Employee class also has the following methods:

- getName(): returns the name of the employee
- getAge(): returns the age of the employee
- getSalary(): returns the salary of the employee
- setSalary(double newSalary): sets the salary of the employee to a new value
- getAnnualSalary(): returns the annual salary of the employee (assuming 12 months in a year)
- raiseSalary(double percentage): increases the salary of the employee by a given percentage

3. The program creates three Employee objects and sets their values using the constructor. Then, the program displays the initial name, age, and salary of each employee using the getName(), getAge(), and getSalary() methods.

4. Next, the program increases the salary of each employee by a given percentage using the raiseSalary() method. Finally, the program displays the new salary of each employee using the getSalary() method and the annual salary of each employee using the getAnnualSalary() method.
